# US Map of Renewable Energy Production

This project intends to inform US policy makers and citizens on which states to focus their environmental efforts (more specifically regarding renewable energy sources). The main part of this project is the data analysis portion done on Jupyter Notebook where the proportion of renewable energies per state to each state's total energy production was calculated. This was then visualized on a React-rendered map of the United States to visually show which states need more attention. 

Using our data, we then trained a model for forecasting purposes of renewable energy production per state and found some accuracy when compared to the observed renewable energy production in the past time frames. We extended this to the future to investigate where each state may be headed based on its current renewable energy production tendencies.
